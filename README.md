# ValveBoard25
Valve board code

What to do:
 - [X] Setup board config on STM32
 - [ ] Setup GPIO pins for valves
 - [ ] Configure LTC2990 to work with current and voltage
 - [ ] Write RTOS tasks for reading voltage, current
 - [ ] Write RTOS tasks for writing voltage to global variables
 - [ ] Write RTOS tasks for reading inputs pins(from RF board)
 - [ ] Write RTOS tasks for scanning global var for whether or not firing is enabled
 - [ ] Write RTOS tasks for activiating valves
 - [ ] Configure ADC(i.e. clock freq) for pressure
